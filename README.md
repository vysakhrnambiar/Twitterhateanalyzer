Twitter Analytics Dashboard
This project is a Twitter Analytics Dashboard designed to help users understand and manage their Twitter experience by analyzing tweet sentiment, visualizing trends, identifying popular topics, and discovering new accounts outside their typical network. By using Playwright for automated tweet extraction and the OpenAI API for sentiment analysis, this tool is accessible to users who donâ€™t want to use a Twitter API key but want a broader perspective on their feed.

Purpose
This tool is ideal for personal use, especially for those who feel that Twitter has become overly negative or who are stuck in an echo chamber. It provides insights into the sentiment of tweets and highlights new trends, giving users a way to discover fresh perspectives and reduce exposure to harmful or repetitive content.

Features

Category Analysis: View trends and counts of tweets categorized by custom-defined tags.
